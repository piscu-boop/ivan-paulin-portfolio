        <h2>üöÄ Building Mamba Smart from Scratch</h2>
        <p>
            Creating Mamba Smart was more than just writing code ‚Äî it was about solving a real problem in the B2B marketing space.
            Working in Dublin with a small but passionate team, we launched the MVP in record time. I led backend development, designed our architecture,
            and later transitioned into the Product Owner role. The experience taught me how to lead, prioritize, and listen to users.

        <h2>üß© Debugging with Confidence</h2>
        <p>
            Every developer has that moment when something *just doesn‚Äôt work*. In this post, I reflect on one of my biggest debugging challenges and
            how approaching it with patience and methodical thinking turned it into a breakthrough. Spoiler: it involved an unexpected Docker issue and
            some Friday night persistence.

        <h2>üìä What Agile Really Taught Me</h2>
        <p>
            Agile is more than sticky notes and sprints. It‚Äôs about continuous delivery, honest retrospectives, and real collaboration. I share what it was
            like to work in Agile teams at Vates and how those experiences shaped the way I approach product development today.
